I am graduating with my Ph.D. in Psychology from The University of Texas in May 2022. 

I leverage evolutionary theory, mixed-methods study design, and applied statistics to answer all of my research questions. 

Outside of research, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee, petting my Dog, Remy, reading fiction books, traveling, and doing yoga. 

Skills:
- Identification of best research methodologies
- Qualitative and quantitative research design
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Applied and descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Peer-review
- Mentorship
