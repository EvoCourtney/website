I have a psychology PhD from UT Austin, and am currently a Quantitative UX Researcher at Expedia Group on the CX measurement team. I leverage mixed-methods, applied statistics, and my graduate training to improve user experiences.

Outside of research, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee, petting my Dog, Remy, reading fiction books, traveling, and doing yoga. Say hi!
