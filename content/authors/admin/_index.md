Courtney's research focuses on studying aspects of men's and women's sexuality using evolutionary theory and cross-cultural methodologies. Specifically, her interests include individual and cultural differences in sexual disgust, religiosity, and moral norms surrounding sexual behavior. 

Courtney will graduate with a Ph.D. in Psychology from The University of Texas in May 2022. She is on the job market.

Outside of research, Courtney enjoys drinking copious amounts of coffee, petting her adorable Dog named Remy, reading fiction books (Amor Towles is superior, no questions), traveling, and doing yoga.
